Here are the raw C++ files that make up the program [MavericK](www.bobverity.com/maverick). These files are distributed under [MIT license](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT), which means you can basically do whatever you want with them as long as you include the original copyright and license notice in any copy of the software/source code.

To all C++ coders out there - if you can see any obvious efficiency gains that can be had in this code then please drop me an e-mail at maverickgenetics.help@gmail.com and I'll try to include them in the next version of the program. The same goes for any bugs of course!
